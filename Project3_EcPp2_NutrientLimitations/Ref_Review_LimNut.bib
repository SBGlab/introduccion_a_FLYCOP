abstract = {Background: The phosphorus compounds serve as major building blocks of many biomolecules, and have important roles in signal transduction. The phosphate is involved in many biochemical reactions by the transfer of phosphoryl groups. All living cells sophisticatedly regulate the phosphate uptake, and survive even under phosphate-limiting condition, and thus phosphate metabolism is closely related to the diverse metabolism including energy and central carbon metabolism. In particular, phosphorylation may play important roles in the metabolic regulation at acidic condition and nitrogen limiting condition, which typically appears at the late growth phase in the batch culture. Moreover, phosphate starvation is a relatively inexpensive means of gene induction in practice, and the phoA promoter has been used for overexpression of heterologous genes. A better understanding of phosphate regulation would allow for optimization of such processes.Results: The effect of phosphate (P) concentration on the metabolism in Escherichia coli was investigated in terms of fermentation characteristics and gene transcript levels for the aerobic continuous culture at the dilution rate of 0.2 h-1. The result indicates that the specific glucose consumption rate and the specific acetate production rate significantly increased, while the cell concentration decreased at low P concentration (10{\%} of the M9 medium). The increase in the specific glucose uptake rate may be due to ATP demand caused by limited ATP production under P-limitation. The lower cell concentration was also caused by less ATP production. The less ATP production by H+-ATPase may have caused less cytochrome reaction affecting in quinone pool, and caused up-regulation of ArcA/B, which repressed TCA cycle genes and caused more acetate production. In the case of phoB mutant (and also phoR mutant), the fermentation characteristics were less affected by P-limitation as compared to the wild type where the PhoB regulated genes were down-regulated, while phoR and phoU changed little. The phoR gene knockout caused phoB gene to be down-regulated as well as PhoB regulated genes, while phoU and phoM changed little. The effect of pH together with lower P concentration on the metabolic regulation was also investigated. In accordance with up-regulation of arcA gene expression, the expressions of the TCA cycle genes such as sdhC and mdh were down-regulated at acidic condition. The gene expression of rpoS was up-regulated, and the expression of gadA was up-regulated at pH 6.0. In accordance with this, PhoB regulated genes were up-regulated in the wild type under P-rich and P-limited conditions at pH 6.0 as compared to those at pH 7.0. Moreover, the effect of nitrogen limitation on the metabolic regulation was investigated, where the result indicates that phoB gene was up-regulated, and PhoB regulated genes were also up-regulated under N-limitation, as well as nitrogen-regulated genes.Conclusion: The present result shows the complicated nature of the metabolic regulation for the fermentation characteristics upon phosphate limitation, acidic condition, and nitrogen limitation based on the transcript levels of selected genes. The result implies that the regulations under phosphate limitation, acidic condition, and nitrogen limitation, which occur typically at the late growth phase of the batch culture, are interconnected through RpoS and RpoD together with Pho genes. {\textcopyright} 2011 Marzan and Shimizu; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.},

abstract = {The synthesis of poly(3-hydroxyalkanoates) (PHA) by Pseudomonas putida KT2442 growing on long-chain fatty acids was studied in continuous cultures. The effects of the growth rate on the biomass and polymer concentration were determined and it was found that the PHA concentrations decreased with increasing growth rates. The highest volumetric productivity was 0.13 g PHA l-1 h-1 at a specific growth rate ($\mu$) of 0.1 h-1. The molecular mass of the polymer remained constant at all growth rates but changes in the monomeric composition of the PHA synthesized were observed. Variation of the carbon to nitrogen (C/N) ratio of the substrate feed at $\mu$ = 0.1 h-1 revealed optimal PHA formation at C/N = 20 mol/mol. In order to optimize PHA production P. putida KT2442 was cultivated to high cell densities in oxygen-limited continuous cultures. In this way a maximum biomass concentration of 30 g/l containing approximately 23{\%} PHA was achieved. This corresponds to a volumetric productivity of 0.69 g l-1 h-1.},

abstract = {Polyhydroxyalkanoate (PHA) metabolism has been traditionally considered as a futile cycle involved in carbon and energy storage. The use of cutting-edge technologies linked to systems biology has improved our understanding of the interaction between bacterial physiology, PHA metabolism and other cell functions in model bacteria such as Pseudomonas putidaKT2440. PHA granules or carbonosomes are supramolecular complexes of biopolyester and proteins that are essential for granule segregation during cell division, and for the functioning of the PHA metabolic route as a continuous cycle. The simultaneous activities of PHA synthase and depolymerase ensure the carbon flow to the transient demand for metabolic intermediates to balance the storage and use of carbon and energy. PHA cycle also determines the number and size of bacterial cells. The importance of PHAs as nutrients for members of the microbial community different to those that produce them is illustrated here via examples of bacterial predators such as Bdellovibrio bacteriovorus that prey on PHA producers and produces specific extra-cellular depolymerases. PHA hydrolysis confers Bdellovibrio ecological advantages in terms of motility and predation efficiency, demonstrating the importance of PHA producers predation in population dynamics. Metabolic modulation strategies for broadening the portfolio of PHAs are summarized and their properties are compiled.},

abstract = {Background: Pseudomonas putida KT2442 is a natural producer of polyhydroxyalkanoates (PHAs), which can substitute petroleum-based non-renewable plastics and form the basis for the production of tailor-made biopolymers. However, despite the substantial body of work on PHA production by P. putida strains, it is not yet clear how the bacterium re-arranges its whole metabolism when it senses the limitation of nitrogen and the excess of fatty acids as carbon source, to result in a large accumulation of PHAs within the cell. In the present study we investigated the metabolic response of KT2442 using a systems biology approach to highlight the differences between single- and multiple-nutrient-limited growth in chemostat cultures.Results: We found that 26, 62, and 81{\%} of the cell dry weight consist of PHA under conditions of carbon, dual, and nitrogen limitation, respectively. Under nitrogen limitation a specific PHA production rate of 0.43 (g{\textperiodcentered}(g{\textperiodcentered}h) -1) was obtained. The residual biomass was not constant for dual- and strict nitrogen-limiting growth, showing a different feature in comparison to other P. putida strains. Dual limitation resulted in patterns of gene expression, protein level, and metabolite concentrations that substantially differ from those observed under exclusive carbon or nitrogen limitation. The most pronounced differences were found in the energy metabolism, fatty acid metabolism, as well as stress proteins and enzymes belonging to the transport system.Conclusion: This is the first study where the interrelationship between nutrient limitations and PHA synthesis has been investigated under well-controlled conditions using a system level approach. The knowledge generated will be of great assistance for the development of bioprocesses and further metabolic engineering work in this versatile organism to both enhance and diversify the industrial production of PHAs. {\textcopyright} 2012 Poblete-Castro et al; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.},

abstract = {Background: Given its high surplus and low cost, glycerol has emerged as interesting carbon substrate for the synthesis of value-added chemicals. The soil bacterium Pseudomonas putida KT2440 can use glycerol to synthesize medium-chain-length poly(3-hydroxyalkanoates) (mcl-PHA), a class of biopolymers of industrial interest. Here, glycerol metabolism in P. putida KT2440 was studied on the level of gene expression (transcriptome) and metabolic fluxes (fluxome), using precisely adjusted chemostat cultures, growth kinetics and stoichiometry, to gain a systematic understanding of the underlying metabolic and regulatory network. Results: Glycerol-grown P. putida KT2440 has a maintenance energy requirement [0.039 (mmolglycerol (gCDW h)-1)] that is about sixteen times lower than that of other bacteria, such as Escherichia coli, which provides a great advantage to use this substrate commercially. The shift from carbon (glycerol) to nitrogen (ammonium) limitation drives the modulation of specific genes involved in glycerol metabolism, transport electron chain, sensors to assess the energy level of the cell, and PHA synthesis, as well as changes in flux distribution to increase the precursor availability for PHA synthesis (Entner-Doudoroff pathway and pyruvate metabolism) and to reduce respiration (glyoxylate shunt). Under PHA-producing conditions (N-limitation), a higher PHA yield was achieved at low dilution rate (29.7 wt{\%} of CDW) as compared to a high rate (12.8 wt{\%} of CDW). By-product formation (succinate, malate) was specifically modulated under these regimes. On top of experimental data, elementary flux mode analysis revealed the metabolic potential of P. putida KT2440 to synthesize PHA and identified metabolic engineering targets towards improved production performance on glycerol. Conclusion: This study revealed the complex interplay of gene expression levels and metabolic fluxes under PHA- and non-PHA producing conditions using the attractive raw material glycerol as carbon substrate. This knowledge will form the basis for the development of future metabolically engineered hyper-PHA-producing strains derived from the versatile bacterium P. putida KT2440.},

abstract = {Poly-3-hydroxybutyrate (PHB) titers in Escherichia coli have benefited from 10+ years of metabolic engineering. In the majority of studies, PHB content, expressed as percent PHB (dry cell weight), is increased, although this increase can be explained by decreases in growth rate or increases in PHB flux. In this study, growth rate and PHB flux were quantified directly in response to systematic manipulation of (1) gene expression in the product-forming pathway and (2) growth rates in a nitrogen-limited chemostat. Gene expression manipulation revealed acetoacetyl-CoA reductase (phaB) limits flux to PHB, although overexpression of the entire pathway pushed the flux even higher. These increases in PHB flux are accompanied by decreases in growth rate, which can be explained by carbon diversion, rather than toxic effects of the PHB pathway. In chemostats, PHB flux was insensitive to growth rate. These results imply that PHB flux is primarily controlled by the expression levels of the product forming pathway and not by the availability of precursors. These results confirm prior in vitro measurements and metabolic models and show expression level is a major affecter of PHB flux. {\textcopyright} 2009 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.},
